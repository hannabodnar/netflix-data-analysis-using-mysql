# Netflix Data Analysis Using MySQL

In this project, I used MySQL to explore patterns and topics in the 'Netflix Movie and TV Shows' dataset.
The dataset is from Kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows

There are two types of files contained in this project. The xxx.sql files contain the MySQL code and the xxx.csv files contain the results from the sql query. 

Some questions I considered while looking through the data:
* Were there more movies or tv shows in the dataset?
* Which country had the most movies/shows released?
* In the United States, which genre had the most releases for TV Shows and Movies?
* Which rating had the most releases?
* In the United States, for each year, which rating had the most releases?

Answers to these questions are in the 'Results' file. Additional observations or trends are in the 'Trends' file.

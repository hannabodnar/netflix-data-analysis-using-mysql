# Netflix Data Analysis Using MySQL

In this project, I used MySQL to explore patterns and topics in the 'Netflix Movie and TV Shows' dataset.
The dataset is from Kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows

There are two types of files contained in this project. The xxx.sql files contain the MySQL code and the xxx.csv files contain the results from the sql query. 

Some questions I considered while looking through the data:
* Were there more movies or tv shows in the dataset?
* Which country had the most movies/shows released?
* Which genre had the most releases?
* Which rating had the most releases?
* In the United States, for each year, which rating had the most releases?

The previous questions will be in the file corresponding to its query along with my analysis.
